# Eclipse GLSP - Theia Integration for GLSP Clients

This package contains the glue code necessary to integrate diagram editors built with the [graphical language server platform](https://github.com/eclipse-glsp/glsp) with [Eclipse Theia](https://github.com/theia-ide/theia).

This project is built with `yarn` and is available from npm via [@eclipse-glsp/theia-integration](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@eclipse-glsp/theia-integration).

## Theia Version compatibility

This package is currently compatible with Theia `<=1.26.0`. Versions `>=1.27.0` are currently not supported, but we are working to provide a fix as soon as possible.
